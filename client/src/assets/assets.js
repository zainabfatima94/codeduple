Make sure you have Node.js installed\n2. Create a new directory for your project\n3. Initialize a new Node.js project:\n   ```bash\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n4. Install Express:\n   ```bash\n   npm install express\n   ```\n5. Save the code above in a file named `app.js`\n6. Create a `public` directory if you want to serve static files\n7. Start the server:\n   ```bash\n   node app.js\n   ```\n\n## Features\n- Basic routes ('/', '/about', '/user/:id')\n- POST route for handling form data\n- Static file serving\n- Error handling\n- JSON body parsing\n\nYou can expand this basic setup by adding more routes, connecting to a database, or adding middleware as needed.",

It aims to shift control from large tech companies to users by leveraging cryptographic protocols and peer-to-peer networks.\n\n### **Key Features of Web3:**\n1. **Decentralization**  \n   - No single entity controls the internet; instead, it operates on distributed networks (like blockchains or peer-to-peer systems).\n   - Contrasts with Web2 (the current internet), dominated by centralized platforms like Google, Facebook, and Amazon.\n\n2. **Blockchain & Cryptocurrency**  \n   - Uses blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Solana) for trustless transactions and smart contracts.\n   - Cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, ETH) enable value transfer without intermediaries.\n\n3. **User Ownership & Digital Identity**  \n   - Users own their data (via **decentralized identity** solutions) and monetize it directly.\n   - NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) allow ownership of digital assets (art, music, virtual land).\n\n4. **Interoperability & Openness**  \n   - Applications (dApps) can interact seamlessly across different blockchains.\n   - Open-source protocols reduce reliance on proprietary platforms.\n\n5. **Tokenized Incentives**  \n   - Users and developers are rewarded with tokens (e.g., governance tokens, staking rewards).\n\n### **Examples of Web3 Technologies:**\n- **DeFi (Decentralized Finance)** â€“ Peer-to-peer financial services (e.g., Uniswap, Aave).  \n- **NFTs & Digital Ownership** â€“ CryptoPunks, OpenSea, and blockchain gaming.  \n- **DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)** â€“ Community-governed entities (e.g., MakerDAO).  \n- **Decentralized Storage** â€“ IPFS, Filecoin (vs. centralized cloud storage like AWS).  \n\n### **Web3 vs. Web2 vs. Web1**\n- **Web1 (1990s-2000s):** Read-only static websites (e.g., early HTML pages).  \n- **Web2 (2000s-present):** Interactive, social media, cloud computing (Facebook, YouTube).  \n- **Web3 (emerging):** Decentralized, user-owned, token-based economies.  \n\n### **Challenges of Web3**\n- **Scalability:** Blockchains struggle with speed and cost (e.g., Ethereum gas fees).  \n- **Regulation:** Governments are still figuring out crypto laws.  \n- **User Experience:** Complex for non-technical users.  \n\nWould you like a deeper dive into any specific aspect? ðŸš€",
